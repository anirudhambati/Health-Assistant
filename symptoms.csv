Abdominal aortic aneurysm,"Treatment for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) depends on several factors, including the aneurysm's size, your age and general health.

In general, if you have a large aneurysm (5.5cm or larger) you will be advised to have surgery, either to strengthen the swollen section of the aorta or to replace it with a piece of synthetic tubing.

This is because the risk of the aneurysm rupturing is usually greater than the risk of having it repaired. 

If you have a small (3.0-4.4cm) or medium (4.5-5.4cm) aneurysm, you will be offered regular scans to check its size.

You will also be given advice on how to slow its growth and reduce the risk of it rupturing – for example, stopping smoking – and perhaps medications to reduce your blood pressure and cholesterol level.",pulsating feeling in your stomach (abdomen),persistent back pain,persistent abdominal pain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
